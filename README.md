# Weather-prediction

Weather prediction and classification is often regarded
as a difficult learning problem in the machine learning
space, owing to the humongous amount of factors involved that
affect it. The predictors invloved also do not always have a linear
relationship to the next dayâ€™s weather and could sometimes be
uncorrelated too. Modelling a classifier or a regression model
for this task is thus challenging. Models that are trained to
classify or model upcoming weather, like other learning models,
should demonstrate good generalization towards unseen data. It
is only after this, that a model can be deemed reliable. In this
work, we attempt weather classification and prediction by means
of a decision tree and a linear regression model respectively.
The latter is also compared to a RidgeCV regression model on
the prediction performance on the test set. Further, the best
performing decision tree and linear regression models are also
trained on an augmented dataset with next day parameter values
also as predictors. Different hypothesis pertaining to the quality
and proficiency of the dataset are also formulated and validated.
